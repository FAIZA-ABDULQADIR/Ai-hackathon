# AI-Driven Technical Book Creation Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technical Precision and Credibility
All technical claims must be grounded in verified sources and official documentation. Content must be accurate, factually correct, and citable. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited with zero tolerance policy. All information must be validated against authoritative sources before publication.

### II. Developer-Centric Approach
Content must be written for intermediate-to-advanced developers with clear, instructional, and highly structured explanations. Writing should be concise and accessible while maintaining technical depth. Examples should reflect real-world use cases and common development scenarios.

### III. Modular and Scalable Structure
Book content must follow Docusaurus conventions with versioning-ready architecture and sidebar-friendly organization. Content should be modular, allowing for easy updates and maintenance. Each module should be self-contained while maintaining coherence with the overall book structure.

### IV. AI-Assisted Co-Development
Leverage Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code for efficient development while maintaining human oversight for quality and accuracy. Use AI tools to enhance productivity without compromising content integrity. Human review is mandatory for all AI-generated content before publication.

### V. Consistency and Standards Compliance
Maintain uniformity in tone, formatting, citation style (inline link citations), and code examples. All content must follow Docusaurus Markdown + MDX conventions. Adhere to established style guides and maintain consistent terminology throughout the book.

### VI. Practical Application Focus
Include runnable, tested code examples in every chapter. Each chapter must contain at least 2 practical examples that readers can execute and verify. Examples should be production-ready and include error handling where appropriate.

### VII. Security-First Development
All code examples must follow security best practices. Input validation, proper authentication, and secure coding patterns must be demonstrated. Content must not include hardcoded secrets or unsafe practices.

### VIII. Performance and Accessibility
Content and code examples must meet performance standards and be accessible to all users. Site performance targets include page load times under 3 seconds and Core Web Vitals compliance. All content must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

### IX. Interactive and Engaging User Experience
Implement interactive elements and modern UI/UX design to enhance reader engagement. Include animated elements, hover effects, and clickable components that provide intuitive navigation and learning experiences. The landing page should feature a sci-fi themed gradient design with interactive feature cards that link to dedicated documentation pages.

## Governance
This constitution governs all aspects of the AI-driven technical book creation project. All content, code, and processes must comply with these principles. Amendments require documentation and approval through the established review process.

All contributions must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified with clear benefits to reader understanding. Use this constitution as the primary guidance document for all project decisions.
