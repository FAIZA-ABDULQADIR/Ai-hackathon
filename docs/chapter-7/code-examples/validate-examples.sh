echo "Chapter 7 Isaac Sim Perception Code Examples Validation"
echo "======================================================"
echo ""
echo "To validate the Chapter 7 Isaac Sim perception examples, follow these steps:"
echo ""
echo "1. Ensure NVIDIA Isaac Sim is installed:"
echo "   - Download from https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim"
echo "   - Requires NVIDIA GPU with RTX capabilities"
echo "   - Install Omniverse Launcher"
echo ""
echo "2. Install required Python dependencies:"
echo "   - pip install numpy opencv-python torch torchvision scipy"
echo "   - Ensure Isaac Sim Python API is accessible"
echo ""
echo "3. For Object Detection Example:"
echo "   - Launch Isaac Sim"
echo "   - Run the object_detection.py script"
echo "   - Observe mock detection results in the visualization window"
echo "   - Check console output for detection information"
echo ""
echo "4. For Semantic Segmentation Example:"
echo "   - Launch Isaac Sim"
echo "   - Run the semantic_segmentation.py script"
echo "   - Observe segmentation results in the visualization window"
echo "   - Check console output for class information"
echo ""
echo "5. For Sensor Fusion Example:"
echo "   - Launch Isaac Sim"
echo "   - Run the sensor_fusion.py script"
echo "   - Observe fused camera-LiDAR results in the visualization window"
echo "   - Check console output for fusion statistics"
echo ""
echo "6. Verify perception pipeline components:"
echo "   - Camera sensor data collection"
echo "   - Mock detection/segmentation results"
echo "   - Visualization and display functionality"
echo "   - Proper error handling"
echo ""
echo "Expected Output:"
echo "- Simulation environment loads without errors"
echo "- Camera and LiDAR sensors initialize successfully"
echo "- Perception algorithms process data in real-time"
echo "- Visualizations display correctly"
echo "- Console output shows detection/segmentation statistics"
echo "- Proper resource cleanup on completion"
echo ""
echo "Note: Full validation requires NVIDIA Isaac Sim installation"
echo "with proper GPU acceleration and Omniverse connectivity."
echo "The examples use mock data to simulate real perception results."
echo "For testing without Isaac Sim, the code structure can be validated separately."
