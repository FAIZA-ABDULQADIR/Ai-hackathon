# Chapter 7: Perception Systems

## Robotic Perception

Robotic perception is the process by which robots interpret sensory data to understand their environment. This includes processing data from cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and other sensors to build a coherent understanding of the world.

## Key Technologies

### Computer Vision

Computer vision enables robots to interpret visual information:
- Object detection and recognition
- Scene understanding
- Feature extraction and matching

### Sensor Fusion

Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensors to create a more accurate and reliable understanding:
- Kalman filtering
- Particle filters
- Multi-sensor integration

## Looking Ahead
