echo "============================================="
echo ""
echo "To validate the Chapter 6 Isaac Sim examples, follow these steps:"
echo ""
echo "1. Ensure NVIDIA Isaac Sim is installed:"
echo "   - Download from https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim"
echo "   - Requires NVIDIA GPU with RTX capabilities"
echo "   - Install Omniverse Launcher"
echo ""
echo "2. Install required Python dependencies:"
echo "   - pip install numpy opencv-python scipy"
echo "   - Ensure Isaac Sim Python API is accessible"
echo ""
echo "3. For Perception Pipeline Example:"
echo "   - Launch Isaac Sim"
echo "   - Open Isaac Sim in the Omniverse launcher"
echo "   - Run the perception_pipeline.py script"
echo "   - Ensure assets are properly loaded from Isaac Sim assets"
echo ""
echo "4. Verify sensor data collection:"
echo "   - Check that camera data is being captured correctly"
echo "   - Verify LiDAR data is being processed"
echo "   - Observe object detection results in the console output"
echo ""
echo "5. For VSLAM and Nav2 Integration:"
echo "   - Ensure ROS/ROS 2 is installed and sourced"
echo "   - Verify Isaac Sim ROS bridge is configured"
echo "   - Test navigation goals and VSLAM pose estimation"
echo ""
echo "Expected Output:"
echo "- Simulation environment loads without errors"
echo "- Camera and LiDAR sensors initialize successfully"
echo "- Sensor data is collected and processed in real-time"
echo "- Object detection identifies contours in the camera view"
echo "- Obstacle detection reports accurate distance measurements"
echo "- Navigation goals are executed in the simulation"
echo ""
echo "Note: Full validation requires NVIDIA Isaac Sim installation"
echo "with proper GPU acceleration and Omniverse connectivity."
echo "For testing without Isaac Sim, mock sensor data can be used."
