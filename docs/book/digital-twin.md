# Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo + Unity)

Digital twin simulation creates virtual replicas of physical robotic systems, enabling testing, validation, and optimization in virtual environments before deployment in the real world. This approach significantly reduces development time, cost, and risk while improving system reliability.

## Overview

Digital twin technology in robotics involves creating high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical robotic systems. These virtual models mirror the behavior, physics, and interactions of their real-world counterparts, enabling comprehensive testing and validation. Gazebo provides physics-accurate simulation with realistic sensors, while Unity offers photorealistic rendering and immersive environments for visual simulation.
