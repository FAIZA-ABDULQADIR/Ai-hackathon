# Chapter 13: Capstone - Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Integrating All Concepts

The capstone project brings together all concepts from this book into a complete autonomous humanoid robot system capable of understanding voice commands, planning actions, navigating environments, identifying objects, and manipulating them.

## System Architecture

### Voice Command Processing

The system processes voice commands through:
- Speech recognition (Whisper)
- Natural language understanding (LLMs)
- Command interpretation and validation

### Planning and Execution

The planning system coordinates:
- High-level task decomposition
- Navigation planning
- Manipulation planning
- Execution monitoring and error recovery

## Looking Forward
