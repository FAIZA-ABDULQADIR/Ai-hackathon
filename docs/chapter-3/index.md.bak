# Chapter 3: URDF and Robot Modeling

## Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is an XML format for representing a robot model. It defines the physical and visual properties of a robot, including links, joints, and their relationships.

## Key Components

### Links

Links represent rigid bodies of the robot. Each link has physical properties like mass, inertia, and visual/collision properties.

### Joints

Joints define the relationship between links. Common joint types include:
- Revolute: Rotational joint with limited range
- Continuous: Rotational joint without limits
- Prismatic: Linear sliding joint
- Fixed: No movement between links
