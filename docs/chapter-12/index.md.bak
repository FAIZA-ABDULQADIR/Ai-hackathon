# Chapter 12: Humanoid Robotics

## Introduction to Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots are designed to mimic human form and behavior. They present unique challenges in control, balance, and locomotion due to their complex kinematic structure and need for dynamic stability.

## Key Challenges

### Kinematics and Dynamics

Humanoid robots require sophisticated kinematic and dynamic models:
- Forward and inverse kinematics
- Dynamic balance and stability
- Multi-degree-of-freedom control

### Control Systems

Control systems for humanoid robots include:
- Walking pattern generation
- Balance control algorithms
- Whole-body control frameworks

## Looking Ahead
