# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Introduction to ROS 2

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the next generation of robotic middleware that provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robotic applications. Built on DDS (Data Distribution Service), ROS 2 offers improved performance, security, and real-time capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2 applications. Each node is a process that performs computation and communicates with other nodes through topics, services, or actions.

### Topics and Publishers/Subscribers

Topics enable asynchronous communication between nodes using a publish/subscribe pattern. Publishers send messages to topics, while subscribers receive messages from topics.

### Services and Actions

Services provide synchronous request/response communication, while actions offer goal-oriented communication with feedback and status updates.

## Looking Ahead

This chapter covers the foundational concepts of ROS 2. In the next chapter, we'll explore URDF and robot modeling in greater detail.
