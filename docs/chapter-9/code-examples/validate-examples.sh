echo "To validate the Chapter 9 VLA model examples, follow these steps:"
echo ""
echo "1. Install required Python dependencies:"
echo "   - pip install torch torchvision torchaudio"
echo "   - pip install transformers"
echo "   - pip install opencv-python numpy"
echo "   - pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3"
echo "   - pip install tqdm"
echo ""
echo "2. For VLA Model Architecture (vla_model.py):"
echo "   - Run the script: python vla_model.py"
echo "   - Verify that the model initializes without errors"
echo "   - Check that forward pass executes successfully"
echo "   - Confirm similarity scoring works"
echo ""
echo "3. For VLA Training Pipeline (vla_training.py):"
echo "   - Run the script: python vla_training.py"
echo "   - Verify that the dataset loads correctly"
echo "   - Check that training loop executes"
echo "   - Confirm model checkpoints are saved"
echo ""
echo "4. For VLA Interaction Interface (vla_interaction.py):"
echo "   - Run the script: python vla_interaction.py"
echo "   - Verify that speech recognition initializes"
echo "   - Check that camera access works (if available)"
echo "   - Test voice command processing"
echo "   - Confirm text-to-speech responses"
echo ""
echo "5. Verify multimodal integration:"
echo "   - Vision-language fusion"
echo "   - Action prediction from inputs"
echo "   - Proper error handling"
echo "   - Resource cleanup"
echo ""
echo "Expected Output:"
echo "- All scripts execute without critical errors"
echo "- Model architectures initialize correctly"
echo "- Training pipeline processes synthetic data"
echo "- Interaction interface responds to commands"
echo "- Proper resource management and cleanup"
echo "- Interaction history saved to JSON file"

echo "Note: The examples use mock implementations where"
echo "real models would be used. For full functionality,"
echo "integrate with actual trained VLA models and"
echo "robotic control systems."
