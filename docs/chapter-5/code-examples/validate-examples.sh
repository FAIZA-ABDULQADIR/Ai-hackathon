echo "Chapter 5 Unity Code Examples Validation"
echo "========================================="
echo ""
echo "To validate the Chapter 5 Unity examples, follow these steps:"
echo ""
echo "1. Ensure Unity 2021.3 LTS or later is installed:"
echo "   - Download from https://unity.com/releases/editor/lts"
echo "   - Install Unity Hub for easier version management"
echo ""
echo "2. Install Unity Robotics Hub package:"
echo "   - Open Unity Hub and create a new 3D project"
echo "   - Go to Window > Package Manager"
echo "   - Click the + button and select 'Add package from git URL...'"
echo "   - Enter: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub.git"
echo ""
echo "3. For ROS Integration Setup:"
echo "   - Install ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill recommended)"
echo "   - Install ROS-TCP-Connector package in Unity"
echo "   - Set up proper network configuration for Unity-ROS communication"
echo ""
echo "4. To test the Robot Controller example:"
echo "   - Create a new Unity scene"
echo "   - Add a Capsule or Cube as the robot body"
echo "   - Attach the RobotController.cs script"
echo "   - Add a Rigidbody component"
echo "   - Create a plane as the ground"
echo "   - Run the scene and use arrow keys to control the robot"
echo ""
echo "5. To test the Physics Simulation example:"
echo "   - Create a joint-based robotic arm"
echo "   - Attach the PhysicsSimulation.cs script to the joint"
echo "   - Configure joint parameters in the inspector"
echo "   - Run the scene and observe joint control"
echo ""
echo "6. To test the Sensor Simulation example:"
echo "   - Add a camera to the robot"
echo "   - Attach the SensorSimulation.cs script"
echo "   - Configure camera and sensor parameters"
echo "   - Run the scene and monitor ROS topics:"
echo "     - rostopic echo /unity_robot/camera/image_raw"
echo "     - rostopic echo /unity_robot/scan"
echo "     - rostopic echo /unity_robot/imu/data"
echo ""
echo "Expected Output:"
echo "- Robot controller responds to input with smooth movement"
echo "- Physics simulation maintains stable joint control"
echo "- Sensor data is published to appropriate ROS topics"
echo "- Camera captures realistic images"
echo "- LiDAR provides accurate distance measurements"
echo "- IMU provides orientation and acceleration data"
echo ""
echo "Note: Full validation requires Unity installation and ROS 2 setup."
echo "For testing without ROS, comment out ROS-related code sections."
