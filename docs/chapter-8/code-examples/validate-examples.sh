echo "Chapter 8 Isaac Sim Navigation Code Examples Validation"
echo "======================================================"
echo ""
echo "To validate the Chapter 8 Isaac Sim navigation examples, follow these steps:"
echo ""
echo "1. Ensure NVIDIA Isaac Sim is installed:"
echo "   - Download from https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim"
echo "   - Requires NVIDIA GPU with RTX capabilities"
echo "   - Install Omniverse Launcher"
echo ""
echo "2. Install required Python dependencies:"
echo "   - pip install numpy opencv-python scipy matplotlib"
echo "   - ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill with Nav2 packages"
echo "   - Ensure Isaac Sim Python API is accessible"
echo ""
echo "3. For VSLAM Demo (vslam_demo.py):"
echo "   - Launch Isaac Sim"
echo "   - Run the vslam_demo.py script"
echo "   - Observe camera pose estimation in the console output"
echo "   - Check for feature detection and motion estimation"
echo ""
echo "4. For Nav2 Controller (nav2_controller.py):"
echo "   - Ensure ROS 2 and Nav2 are properly installed and sourced"
echo "   - Launch Isaac Sim with ROS bridge enabled"
echo "   - Run the nav2_controller.py script"
echo "   - Observe waypoint navigation in Isaac Sim"
echo "   - Check console output for navigation progress"
echo ""
echo "5. For Path Planning (path_planning.py):"
echo "   - Launch Isaac Sim"
echo "   - Run the path_planning.py script"
echo "   - Observe path planning results in console and visualization"
echo "   - Check for A* algorithm execution and path optimization"
echo ""
echo "6. Verify navigation pipeline components:"
echo "   - Sensor data collection (camera for VSLAM)"
echo "   - Path planning algorithm execution"
echo "   - Navigation goal execution"
echo "   - Proper error handling and cleanup"
echo ""
echo "Expected Output:"
echo "- Simulation environment loads without errors"
echo "- Navigation algorithms execute successfully"
echo "- Path planning finds valid routes around obstacles"
echo "- VSLAM estimates camera motion and builds maps"
echo "- Nav2 executes waypoints with proper feedback"
echo "- Console output shows algorithm progress and results"
echo "- Proper resource cleanup on completion"
echo ""
echo "Note: Full validation requires NVIDIA Isaac Sim installation"
echo "with proper GPU acceleration, Omniverse connectivity,"
echo "and ROS 2/Nav2 integration. The examples demonstrate"
echo "the structure and approach for Isaac Sim navigation systems."
