# Chapter 8: VSLAM and Navigation

## Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM)

VSLAM is a technique that allows robots to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously tracking their location within that map using visual data from cameras.

## Navigation Systems

### Path Planning

Path planning algorithms determine optimal routes for robot navigation:
- Global planners (A*, Dijkstra's algorithm)
- Local planners (DWA, TEB)
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance

### Navigation Stack

The navigation stack integrates multiple components:
- Costmap management
- Localization (AMCL)
- Path execution and monitoring

## Looking Ahead
