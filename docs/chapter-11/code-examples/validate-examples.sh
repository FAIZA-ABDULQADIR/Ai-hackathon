echo "To validate the Chapter 11 humanoid robotics examples, follow these steps:"
echo ""
echo "1. Install required Python dependencies:"
echo "   - pip install torch numpy scipy matplotlib"
echo "   - pip install opencv-python"
echo "   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is available"
echo ""
echo "2. For Humanoid Controller (humanoid_controller.py):"
echo "   - Run the script: python humanoid_controller.py"
echo "   - Verify that the control architecture initializes"
echo "   - Check that the control loop runs without errors"
echo "   - Confirm that torque computation works"
echo ""
echo "3. For Embodied AI Learning (embodied_ai_learning.py):"
echo "   - Run the script: python embodied_ai_learning.py"
echo "   - Verify that the AI model initializes"
echo "   - Check that the learning loop executes"
echo "   - Confirm that reward computation works"
echo ""
echo "4. For Locomotion Controller (locomotion_controller.py):"
echo "   - Run the script: python locomotion_controller.py"
echo "   - Verify that ZMP computation works"
echo "   - Check that trajectory generation executes"
echo "   - Confirm that visualization displays"
echo ""
echo "5. Verify humanoid-specific functionality:"
echo "   - Balance control algorithms"
echo "   - Locomotion pattern generation"
echo "   - Whole-body control integration"
echo "   - Safety system implementation"
echo ""
echo "Expected Output:"
echo "- All scripts execute without critical errors"
echo "- Humanoid controller initializes with proper joint count"
echo "- AI learning system trains successfully"
echo "- Locomotion controller generates stable walking patterns"
echo "- ZMP-based balance control functions properly"
echo "- Trajectory visualization displays correctly"
echo "- Proper resource cleanup on completion"

echo "Note: The examples use simulation for demonstration."
echo "For full functionality, integrate with actual humanoid"
echo "robot hardware and control systems."
