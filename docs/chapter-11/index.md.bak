# Chapter 11: Action Execution

## Executing Robotic Actions

Action execution is the process of converting high-level plans into specific robotic behaviors. This involves coordinating multiple subsystems to perform complex tasks reliably.

## ROS Actions

### Action Architecture

ROS actions provide goal-oriented communication:
- Goal: Request for the action to be performed
- Feedback: Updates on progress toward the goal
- Result: Final outcome of the action

### Integration with Planning Systems

Action execution integrates with planning systems:
- Plan execution monitoring
- Error handling and recovery
- Status reporting to higher-level systems

## Looking Ahead
