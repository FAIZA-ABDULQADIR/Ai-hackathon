# Chapter 4: Gazebo Simulation

## Introduction to Gazebo

Gazebo is a powerful robotics simulator that provides accurate physics simulation, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces. It enables testing of robotics applications without the need for physical hardware.

## Core Features

### Physics Simulation

Gazebo uses robust physics engines to simulate real-world physics including:
- Collision detection
- Mass, friction, and damping properties
- Joint constraints and limits

### Sensor Simulation

Gazebo provides realistic simulation of various sensors:
- Camera sensors
- LiDAR and other range sensors
- IMU and other inertial sensors

## Looking Ahead
