echo "To validate the Chapter 10 VLA manipulation examples, follow these steps:"
echo ""
echo "1. Install required Python dependencies:"
echo "   - pip install torch torchvision torchaudio"
echo "   - pip install transformers"
echo "   - pip install opencv-python numpy scipy"
echo "   - pip install tqdm"
echo ""
echo "2. For VLA Manipulation Model (vla_manipulation_model.py):"
echo "   - Run the script: python vla_manipulation_model.py"
echo "   - Verify that the VLA manipulation model initializes"
echo "   - Check that forward pass executes successfully"
echo "   - Confirm manipulation action prediction works"
echo ""
echo "3. For Manipulation Dataset (manipulation_dataset.py):"
echo "   - Run the script: python manipulation_dataset.py"
echo "   - Verify that the dataset loads correctly"
echo "   - Check that training pipeline executes"
echo "   - Confirm model training runs without errors"
echo ""
echo "4. For Advanced Manipulation Controller (advanced_manipulation_controller.py):"
echo "   - Run the script: python advanced_manipulation_controller.py"
echo "   - Verify that manipulation sequences execute"
echo "   - Check grasp and place operations"
echo "   - Confirm complex manipulation tasks work"
echo ""
echo "5. Verify manipulation-specific functionality:"
echo "   - Grasp pose prediction"
echo "   - Trajectory generation"
echo "   - Force control outputs"
echo "   - Multi-object manipulation"
echo "   - Language-guided manipulation"
echo ""
echo "Expected Output:"
echo "- All scripts execute without critical errors"
echo "- VLA manipulation models initialize correctly"
echo "- Dataset loads and training runs"
echo "- Manipulation controllers execute sequences"
echo "- Grasp and place operations complete"
echo "- Complex manipulation tasks execute"
echo "- Proper resource management and cleanup"

echo "Note: The examples use mock implementations where"
echo "real models would be used. For full functionality,"
echo "integrate with actual trained VLA manipulation"
echo "models and robotic control systems."
