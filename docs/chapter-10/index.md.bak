# Chapter 10: Planning Systems

## AI Planning in Robotics

Planning systems in robotics involve generating sequences of actions to achieve specific goals. Modern AI planning integrates LLMs to create high-level task plans that can be executed by robotic systems.

## Planning Approaches

### Hierarchical Task Planning

Hierarchical planning breaks complex tasks into manageable subtasks:
- High-level goal decomposition
- Mid-level task sequencing
- Low-level action execution

### Integration with LLMs

LLMs enhance planning capabilities:
- Natural language command interpretation
- Context-aware plan generation
- Adaptive plan modification

## Looking Ahead
