# ADR-002: AI-Assisted Authoring Workflow

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-12-07

## Context
We need to establish an efficient workflow for creating a comprehensive technical book with 8-12 chapters and 8,000-12,000 words. The workflow must accelerate content creation while maintaining quality and consistency across all chapters. We need to leverage AI tools to assist with content generation, code examples, and technical accuracy validation while maintaining human oversight for quality assurance.

## Decision
We will implement an AI-assisted authoring workflow using:
- **Primary Tools**: Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code for content generation
- **Methodology**: Spec-Driven Development for structured content creation
- **Process**: Research-concurrent workflow (research + writing in parallel)
- **Quality Control**: Human oversight for all AI-generated content
- **Focus**: Innovation-driven content creation with advanced AI capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- Accelerates content creation for 8-12 comprehensive chapters
- Maintains consistency across the full 8,000-12,000 word book
- Generates innovative code examples with technical accuracy validation
- Assists with Docusaurus configuration and advanced best practices
- Enables creation of cutting-edge technical content with AI assistance
- Generates interactive elements and innovative content formats
- Reduces manual effort while maintaining quality standards

### Negative
- Requires human oversight for quality assurance
- Potential for AI-generated content to need significant editing
- Learning curve for AI-assisted content creation tools
- Risk of technical inaccuracies without proper validation
- Possible dependency on AI tools for content generation

## Alternatives
- **Manual-only approach**: Traditional content creation without AI assistance, slower but with full human control
- **AI-only approach**: Heavy reliance on AI without human oversight, faster but with quality risks
- **Different AI tools**: Alternative AI platforms instead of Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code
- **Traditional documentation workflow**: Standard approach without innovation focus
